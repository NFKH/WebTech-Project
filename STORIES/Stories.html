    <p class="drop-cap">Today, for better and for worse, the Internet is a part of all of our lives. But it wasn’t
        always so. This week,
        we’re bringing you pieces from the early days of tech culture, when going online was a novelty and kids still
        played outside. In “My First Flame,” from 1994, John Seabrook describes his first experience with online insults
        and trolling (“in any other medium, these words would be, literally, unspeakable”); he also undertakes an
        electronic correspondence with Bill Gates, in “E-Mail from Bill.” (“We were intimate in a curious way, in the
        sense of being wired into each other’s minds, but our contact was elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing.”)
        In “Virtual Love,” from 1997, Meghan Daum experiments with Internet dating, despite not being “what most people
        would call a ‘computer person.’ ” John Heilemann, John Cassidy, and Michael Specter offer early profiles of
        Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, respectively. Erik Larson recounts the story of
        iVillage, the Internet company whose two female co-founders, Nancy Evans and Candice Carpenter, became
        unimaginably rich through an I.P.O., despite being “neither ‘Web heads’ nor computer geeks,” signalling a new
        era in tech. Lauren Collins explores a new form of self-expression—the clever naming of one’s Wi-Fi network.
        Nicholson Baker uses a Kindle for the first time and wonders if a device could ever be better than a book.
        Finally, in a Talk of the Town story, from 1977, Anthony Hiss visits an acquaintance in California with a new
        hobby: assembling his own personal computer. Eventually, his acquaintance predicts, people will “start hooking
        their machines in with their friends’ machines, and people will get on nets of computers, which could mean you
        could vote or buy something while sitting at your own computer keyboard.” He notes that “if the electricity
        fails, the kids will be in trouble.” He didn’t know the half of it.</p>

    <p>“I got flamed for the first time a couple of months ago. To flame, according to ‘Que’s Computer User’s
        Dictionary,’ is ‘to lose one’s self-control and write a message that uses derogatory, obscene, or inappropriate
        language.’ ”</p>

    <p>“Thanks to the computer, I was involved in a well-defined courtship, a neat little space in which he and I were
        both safe to express the panic and the fascination of our mutual affection.”</p>

    <p>“Steve Jobs’s mastery of perception has long been known to his allies and his detractors alike as his
        ‘reality-distortion field’—an uncanny ability, through enthusiasm, charisma, and intimidation, to make people
        see what he wants them to see.”</p>

    <p>“The growth of sites like Facebook and MySpace reflects a dramatic shift in how young people view the Internet.”

    <p><span class="underline">“The Tao of Wi-Fi”</span></p>
    <p>“Wireless names can act as welcome mats, luring their beholder into a store or a discussion, or as gargoyles,
        patrolling a patch of virtual turf.”</p>
    <hr>
    <p><span class="underline">“Free Money”</span></p>
    <p>“A company as ethereal as air, with deep losses, few physical assets, little proprietary technology, extravagant
        rates of spending, a high employee ‘burn rate,’ and powerful emerging competitors, had accomplished one of the
        most successful I.P.O.s ever.”</p>

    <p>“Here’s what you buy when you buy a Kindle book. You buy the right to display a grouping of words in front of
        your eyes for your private use with the aid of an electronic display device approved by Amazon.”</p>

    <p><span class="underline">“Search and Deploy”</span></p>
    <p>“At the age of twenty-seven, Lawrence Page runs—with a fellow former Stanford graduate student, Sergey Brin—a
        small company, based in Mountain View, California, named Google, which has become the default search engine of
        the digital in-crowd.”</p>

    <p>“In just a matter of weeks, a couple of men in their twenties from Los Altos, California will start selling
        Apple II—a fully assembled briefcase-size unit, with a large memory and a keyboard, that can play any number of
        computer games, draw pictures on your color TV, and operate like any other computer.”</p>
